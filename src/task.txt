Task A:

- Create a new file called Button.js.
- Import the styled function from styled-components.
- Create a new styled component called StyledButton using the styled function.
- Add styling to StyledButton using CSS. For example, you might set the background color, font size, and padding.
- Add a hover effect to StyledButton using the &:hover selector. For example, you might change the background color and add a box-shadow.
- Export the StyledButton component from the file.
- Use the StyledButton component in your application by importing it and rendering it as a normal React component.

Task B:
- Create a text file and make an object containing keys with strings.
- Remember to use capital letters for text objects and keys. 
- const TEXT = {
    TEXT_KEY_ONE = "This is text",
    TEXT_KEY_TWO = "This is also text"
}
- Import that text object and use props to display the text in your component.
